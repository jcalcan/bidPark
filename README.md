  **Tech used**

This project was fun and challenging. I used PostgreSQL to manage user registration and Auth. The site currently is v1 so its a basic design to test frontend and backend. v1.1 will be the design for users to enjoy.

**Description and Functionality**
BidPark is a site that allows you to auction your parking spot. Users can select their spot on the map and start an auction for other users to bid on. No need to install special extensions. Plans to improve the project includes API show all the auctions .25 mile radius from user location at startup, design frontend and payment processing.
